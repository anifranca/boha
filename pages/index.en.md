# Introduction

**BOHA** is a project in which we have mapped the growing field of Environmental History in Latin America, and we have included publications in three languages â€“ Portuguese, English and Spanish - which references are now available through the searchable software Zotero. We have also included links to newspapers, magazines and conferences articles on most rmajor research topics in Latin America environmental history. Our [database](/data) is updated frequently with new items written in Spanish and Portuguese, and it counts already with more than 1500 references. Please keep sending us your references. Your contribution is really important to the continuous development of this project. Thanks for your visit!
